        <p>Introduction</p>

        <p>I'm Biswa</p>
        <p>
          I got into tech early through robotics and programming, and I fell in
          love with building things. I started a research project on analyzing
          financial markets that later turned into a startup, we built software
          to analyze stock prices using current events and historical patterns.
          It ranked 5th in the Startup India challenge and received â‚¹2.5L in
          funding. After that, I joined Dukaan, where I built an orchestration
          system for LLMs that cut token I/O costs by 80%. I enjoy solving
          problems and building things that actually make a difference.

        <p>Software Engineer | January 2025</p>
        <p>
          Built the voice agent platform (Atoms), focusing on concurrency and
          batch processing in LLM services using queues. Developed an event
          metrics system to evaluate agent performance and response quality.

        <p>Backend Engineer | July 2024 - December 2024</p>
        <p>
          Designed and implemented the Bot9.ai (v2) backend. Developed document
          ingestion and data scraping pipelines for AI model training. Achieved
          12ms response latency for document retrieval in the same region.
          Engineered an agent orchestration system that saved approximately
          $100,000 annually by optimizing LLM I/O token usage.
